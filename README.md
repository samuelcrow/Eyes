# Eyes
Eyes is a fun little game where the eyes follow your mouse.  
## Eyes Exercise    
This is a fun exercise that I build with the help of MIT | xPro that has eyes on the screen that follow the curser of your mouse.  It uses very simple html, css, and javascript so you could quickly make any changes you wanted after downloading these files.
